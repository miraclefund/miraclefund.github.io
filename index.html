        <h1>Miracle Fund: The Truth</h1>
        <p> 
Hi everyone. We will not respond to any questions or remarks. The Miracle Fund as it stands today has NEVER claimed to be a charity, it has always been and still is a group of local people who donate their time, money and effort to help those less fortunate. Sometimes through a campaign, sometimes by anonymous donations of food and money, sometimes by joining in with others who are trying to help people in the community and sometimes, by just knocking on a door to make sure the lone occupant is okay.<br><br> 
 
Eventually, it WILL become a registered Charity and part of Peninsula Jump, as stated. Funds WILL be channeled through there to those in need.<br><br>  
 
It is with great pity and sadness that we speak to you today. Living in a small and tight-knit community, we thought we would do our part to help those among us, who either face illness or hardship. Our efforts however, have been hijacked by some who for their own purposes, have made it their mission to “bring us down”.<br><br>  
 
A restraining order has been strongly recommended to us by the Rosebud Police, after two separate discussions. We chose NOT to follow this advice on the first occasion, but the events this week leave us no choice now but to follow through. This relentless campaign to sully our names, reputations, and potentially expose us to harm, must and WILL come to an end.<br><br>  
 
As we stated earlier, we do not really care about opinions, doubts, and humourless remarks about Peninsula Jump. We don't care about those of you trying to “uncover” the who is behind it and spreading bits and pieces of research that you think is proof of this and that. We too love a good conspiracy, and we actually have a giggle or two at all the furious “research” being conducted and the amazing suppositions being put forward. All that will be forgotten once PJ is operational, so really, it is of no relevance, nor does it affect or offend us. While you are all busy doing that, we too are busy, getting on with things.<br><br>  
 
What we do find offensive however, is the allegation that we have been dishonest in our fundraising efforts. The campaign for our beloved Tasha, and we are really very sorry to the family for having to mention this little Angel, was, and still is one of the most rewarding experiences we have ever had. Support from the community was immense, and her day was a huge success, both in terms of funds raised for the family family, and also increasing awareness of NF, the disease that took her young and precious life.<br><br>  
 
We could do very little to help young Tasha, but we made sure her family had some of their financial burdens eased, and some of the stresses removed.<br><br>  
 
Initially the agreement between ourselves and Tasha's family was for us to receive $10 from every sale of the tee-shirts specially created for the record-breaking event. This was to cover costs of posting, handling and delivery within the area, as well as covering the enormous administrative burden of creating her special day.<br><br>  
 
In the end however, we decided that PJ and everyone associated with her campaign would NOT accept any compensation. Tasha touched us all, and it was deemed an honour simply to have known her, and her wonderful family. That was payment enough. Despite protests from the family, we did not accept any monetary compensation for the tee-shirts or for personal out of pocket expenses, time, and effort expended.<br><br>  
 
We then asked if there was another family we could help in a similar fashion. The enormous satisfaction we received from Tasha's campaign found us eager to once again to make a difference in someone's life.<br><br>  
 
Krystina Turner was suggested by one of our supporters. She also made contact herself and nominated her family. We knew very little about this family's situation, other than the fact that there were two high-needs children who would potentially benefit from a fund-raiser.<br><br>  
 
We subsequently made personal contact with the family and proposed a two tiered campaign, joining forces with Wignall Ford and coordinating two separate events. One was the Wignall Sale, whereby $100 from every car sold over a period of four days would go towards the family. The other, initially in conjunction with The Australian Book of Records, was going to be a Record creating/breaking event, to be held at Wignall Kia in Mornington. The family were at all times aware of the fact that there were to be two separate fund-raisers. They were also aware, and agreed that any invoices raised from our event would be paid by them, out of the special account created for this fundraiser, in their names as trustees for the two children.<br><br>  
 
Similarly to Tasha's campaign, there were bills to be paid. Graphic Designer, Tee-shirt printer, Australian Book of Records, incidentals including items needed for the event. For transparency and accountability, we also included our out of pocket expenses, backed by receipts.<br><br>  
 
From the beginning, and contrary to what we had been promised by the family, there were no offers of help, no support from their extensive network of family and friends, and no involvement by the community despite paid advertising on Facebook and sharing among the many local Pages and Groups. Because our event was timed to coincide with the Wignall Ford Sale weekend, panic set in when we realized the community had failed to embrace our event.<br><br>  
 
This was discussed with the family, we alerted them to our concerns, and asked why their extensive network were NOT coming to their aid. We were told that people are funny like that, and that there are people in our community who do not understand how difficult it is to raise high-needs children. Following this discussion, we then switched to a Carnival Day, in an attempt to generate more interest within the community. Once again, and despite further paid advertising by ourselves and assurances from the family that they would involve their extensive network to promote, help and attend the event, nothing materialized.<br><br>  
 
At this point, we had invested a substantial amount of our own money, as well as time and effort. We printed off 100 tee-shirts which the family signed off on and promised to help sell to their family and friends both here and overseas.<br><br>  
 
Only one tee-shirt was sold. 30 or so went to Wignall Ford staff to wear during their Sales drive. The rest we have in a box in storage. Wignall paid $1,000, we paid the balance of $600. As no tees were sold prior to the Event Day, Wignall covered the total cost, and we agreed to reimburse the balance later, out of our own pocket.<br><br>  
 
Carnival Day was not attended by a single member of the extended family and their network of friends, apart from Krystina, her daughter and Victoria. Two other local families attended, after we had printed 500 flyers again at our expense and spent many days distributing them in shopping districts and markets. It was at the very least, a dismal failure in terms of community engagement and support, and despite extensive advertising targeting the Mornington Peninsula.<br><br>  
 
The agreement between ourselves and the family from the very start was that they would receive the Wignall Ford funds in full. These funds would have no costs associated with them and no invoices raised. This was to primarily ensure that the family received some funds, in case our efforts failed. They were aware at all times that these funds would be available to them in full, the amount depending only on the variance of cars sold during the campaign.<br><br>  
 
In an effort to promote the event further and raise funds outside of Event Day, and similarly to our previous campaign, we also conducted a raffle. We sold tickets for $2.00 each, and had a major prize as well as 20 hampers as minor prizes. We canvassed local businesses, market stall holders and our own network and managed to procure donated items for the hampers, as well as purchasing the rest of the hamper fillers ourselves.<br><br>  
 
The hampers were purchased from local Opportunity shops, at an average price of $3-5 each. Contrary to what is being said, NONE of the Opportunity shops donated any goods either towards the Carnival or the hampers. We have receipts for every single purchase, and they amount to several hundred dollars as stated on the Profit and Loss Statement.<br><br>  
 
We also incurred a debt to the Australian Book of Records as, we had consulted both in face to face meetings and via email, for the Record Event that had to be canceled due to lack of interest by the community. The total cost of this is also shown on the Profit and Loss Statement and is backed by an invoice by the Company.<br><br>  
 
As well, there was a debt to the Graphic Designer, for the logo and purchase of the picture for the tee-shirt. There was an invoice raised for this also.<br><br>  
 
We did sell some raffle tickets, and decided to hold off on the draw that was scheduled to take place during the Carnival, in the hope that we can sell some more. The raffle draw was conducted on the Sunday following the Carnival Day, the winners were announced on the Miracle Fund page, and also contacted via phone and text messages. All hampers were picked up or delivered in the week following the draw except for four, which were won by stall-holders of local Markets, and were delivered to them at the next scheduled Market.<br><br>  
 
Everything in the Profit and Loss statement is true and correct, backed by invoices, receipts, and PayPal/bank statements. The family received the Wignall funds in full. We sustained an enormous loss from this campaign, and used the raffle ticket income to offset a little of this loss. Given the enormous amount of time, energy, effort, and personal funds we invested, this figure represented a very small percentage in terms of “administration” costs.<br><br>  
 
Two very different Fundraising Campaigns. One embraced by the community and successful beyond all expectations. One ignored by the community, sustaining a huge loss for ourselves, yet due to our forward thinking, the family receiving a substantial amount from a very generous Wignall Ford.<br><br>  
 
There is success and failure risk in every endeavour. Especially so in fund-raising, as you are relying mostly on the generosity of others. Lessons have been learned from both campaigns.<br><br>  
 
However, to take one's good intentions and use them to vilify, slander, cast aspersions and publicly cry “foul” when all of the above are factually correct, is tantamount to a personal vendetta, using public forums to air personal grievances. The public love to jump on bandwagons. They especially love to expose supposed scams and wrong-doing. This is in some ways good. It keeps us all honest and does highlight things we should all be wary of.<br><br>  
 
If a personal vendetta however is constantly fuelled by lies and mis-information, then the public itself has a decision to make. In a democratic society, everyone is given the right to respond, and everyone is innocent unless PROVEN otherwise. This is the problem with bandwagons. If you jump on, knowing only one side of the story, you are bound to be biased in your response and your support. So please. Carefully consider all of the above, and now that you have both sides of the story for both campaigns, form a clear and unbiased opinion.<br><br>  
 
There are many good people out there, generously giving time, effort and financial aid to those less fortunate. We are good people. We will continue to help others, both publicly and privately, when we see a real need arise. We will, however in future be a lot more thorough in our investigations prior to offering help. It is distasteful to us that we must do this, because charity should be UNCONDITIONAL. Assumptions however, are what this public vilification has been based on, and what we ourselves based our second fund-raiser on. And assumptions sometimes do make asses of us all.
