        <h1>Miracle Fund: The Truth</h1>
        <p> 

	
Hi everyone. We will not respond to any further questions or remarks. The Miracle Fund as it stands today has NEVER claimed to be a charity, it has been and still is a group of local people who donate their time, effort and money to help those less fortunate. Sometimes through a campaign, sometimes by anonymous donations of food and money, sometimes by joining in with others who are trying to help people in the community and sometimes, by just knocking on a door to make sure the lone occupant is okay.<br><br> 
 
Eventually, it WILL become a registered Charity and part of Peninsula Jump, as stated. Funds WILL be channeled through there to those in need.<br><br>  
 
It is with great pity and sadness that we speak to you today. Living in a small and tight-knit community, we thought we should do our part to help those among us, who either face illness or hardship. Our efforts however, have been hijacked by some who for their own purposes, have made it their mission to “bring us down”.<br><br>   
 
A restraining order has been strongly recommended to us by the Rosebud Police, after two separate discussions and evidence presented to them. We chose NOT to follow this advice on the first occasion, however events this week both on and off line leave us no choice but to now follow through. This relentless campaign to sully our names, reputations, and potentially expose us to harm, must and WILL come to an end.<br><br>   
 
Anyone associated with the particular person against whom the intervention order is in place, and any of the many aliases associated with this person, who then continue to post publicly any derogatory comments regarding individuals previously named, individuals inferred to but not named, Peninsula Jump, The Miracle Fund and any other person associated with any of the above will be breaching this order and subsequently facing criminal charges. This is a horrendous situation, but we have been left with no alternative, because we have families and children to protect, as well as our rights to privacy, and to be allowed to peacefully carry out our lives and endeavours.<br><br>   
 
As we stated earlier,  we do not really care about opinions, doubts, and humourless remarks regarding Peninsula Jump. We don't care about those of you trying to “uncover” the who is behind it and spreading bits and pieces of research that you think is proof of this and that. We too love a good conspiracy, and we actually have had a giggle or two at all the furious “research” being conducted and the amazing suppositions being put forward. All that will be forgotten of course once PJ is operational, so really, it is of no relevance, nor does it affect or offend us. While you are all busy doing that, we too are busy, getting on with things.<br><br>  
 
What we do find offensive however, and what we must address, is the allegation that we have been dishonest in our fund-raising efforts.<br><br>   
 
The campaign for our beloved Tasha, and we are really very sorry to the family for having to mention this little Angel, was, and still is one of the most rewarding experiences we have ever had. Support from the community was immense, and her day was a huge success, both in terms of funds raised for the family, and also increasing awareness of NF, the disease that took her young and precious life.<br><br>   
 
We could do very little to help young Tasha, but we made sure her family had some of their financial burdens eased, and some of the stresses removed.<br><br>   
 
Initially the agreement between ourselves and Tasha's family was for us to receive $10 from every sale of the tee-shirts specially created for her record-breaking event. This was to cover costs of posting, handling and delivery within the area, as well as covering the enormous administrative burden of creating her special day.<br><br>  
 
In the end however, and totally devastated by her tragic loss, we decided that PJ and everyone associated with her campaign would NOT accept any compensation. Tasha touched us all, and it was deemed an honour simply to have known her, and her wonderful family. That was payment enough. Despite protests from the family, we did not accept any monetary compensation from the tee-shirts or for personal out of pocket expenses, time, and effort expended.<br><br>  
 
We made the Profit and Loss Statement public on the page, so the community could see how much money was raised, and how the funds were generated, as well as the payments that were settled by the family on presentation of invoices.<br><br>   
 
We then asked if there was another family we could help in a similar fashion. The enormous satisfaction we received from Tasha's campaign found us eager to once again to make a difference in someone's life.<br><br>  
 
Krystina Turner was suggested by one of our supporters. She also made contact herself and nominated her family. We knew very little about this family's situation, other than the fact that there were two high-needs children who could potentially benefit from a fund-raiser.<br><br>   
 
We subsequently made personal contact with the family and proposed a two tiered campaign, joining forces with Wignall Ford and coordinating two separate events. One was the Wignall Sale, whereby $100 from every car sold over a period of four days would go towards the family. The other, initially in conjunction with The Australian Book of Records, was going to be a Record creating/breaking event, to be held at Wignall Kia in Mornington. The family were at all times aware of the fact that there were to be two separate fund-raisers. They were also aware, and agreed that any invoices raised from our event would be paid by them, out of the special account created for this fundraiser, in their names as trustees for the two children. Exactly the same situation as with the previous Campaign. NO public funds channelled into the Miracle Fund, and payment from the family ONLY on presentation of an invoice.<br><br>  
 
Similarly to Tasha's campaign, there were bills to be paid. Graphic Designer, Tee-shirt printer, Australian Book of Records, incidentals including items needed for the event. For transparency and accountability, we also included our out of pocket expenses, backed by receipts.<br><br>  
 
From the beginning, and contrary to what we had been promised by the family, there were no offers of help, no support from their extensive network of family and friends, and no involvement by the community despite paid advertising on Facebook and sharing among the many local Pages and Groups. Because our event was timed to coincide with the Wignall Ford Sale weekend, panic set in when we realized the community had failed to embrace our event.  
This was discussed with the family, we alerted them to our concerns, and asked why their extensive network were NOT coming to their aid. We were told that people are funny like that, and that there are people in our community who do not understand how difficult it is to raise high-needs children. Following this discussion, we then switched to a Carnival Day, in an attempt to generate more interest within the community. Once again, and despite further paid advertising by ourselves and assurances from the family that they would involve their extensive network to promote, help and attend the event, nothing materialized.<br><br>   
 
At this point, we had invested a substantial amount of our own money, as well as time and effort. We printed 100 tee-shirts which the family signed off on and promised to help sell to their family and friends both here and overseas.<br><br>   
 
Only one tee-shirt was sold. 30 or so went to Wignall Ford staff to wear during their Sales drive. The rest we have in a box in storage. Wignall paid $1,000, we paid the balance of $600. As no tees were sold prior to Event Day and NO income whatsoever generated in the preceding month through donations, Wignall covered the total cost of printing the tees, and we agreed to reimburse the balance later, out of our own pocket.<br><br>   
 
Carnival Day was not attended by a single member of the extended family and the network of friends, apart from Krystina, her daughter and Victoria. Two other local Mornington families attended, after we had printed 500 flyers again at our expense and spent many days distributing them in shopping districts and markets. It was at the very least, a dismal failure in terms of community engagement and support, and despite extensive advertising targeting the Mornington Peninsula. We wondered then and still do now, why the general public did not engage, and more importantly, where all these people who are now making and generating these allegations were, when they were really needed by this family.<br><br>  
 
The agreement between ourselves and the family from the very start was that they would receive the Wignall Ford funds in full. These funds would have no costs associated with them and no invoices raised against them. This was to primarily ensure that the family received some funds, in case our efforts failed. They were aware at all times that these funds would be available to them in full, the amount depending only on the variance of cars sold during the campaign.<br><br>   
 
In an effort to promote the event further and raise funds outside of Event Day, and similarly to our previous campaign, we also conducted a raffle. We sold tickets for $2.00 each, and had a major prize as well as 20 hampers as minor prizes. We canvassed local businesses, market stall holders and our own network and managed to procure donated items for the hampers, as well as purchasing the rest of the hamper fillers ourselves.<br><br>  
 
The hampers were purchased from local Opportunity shops, at an average price of $3-5 each. Contrary to what is being said in subsequent online discussions, NONE of the Opportunity shops donated any goods, either towards the Carnival or the hampers. We have receipts for every single purchase, and they amount to several hundred dollars as indicated in the Profit and Loss Statement.<br><br>  
 
We also incurred a debt to the Australian Book of Records as we had consulted both in face to face meetings and via email, for the Record Event that had to be cancelled due to lack of interest by the community. The total cost of this is also shown on the Profit and Loss Statement and is backed by an invoice from the Company. 
As well, there was a debt to the Graphic Designer, for the logo and purchase of the picture for the tee-shirt. There was an invoice raised for this also.<br><br>  
 
We did sell some raffle tickets, but nowhere near enough to even cover the costs, so we decided to hold off on the draw that was scheduled to take place during the Carnival, in the hope that we could sell some more. Despite trying two different areas not previously covered, we failed to sell more than a few extra tickets. The raffle draw was conducted on the Sunday following the Carnival Day, the winners were announced on the Miracle Fund Page, and also contacted via phone and text messages. All hampers were picked up or delivered in the week following the draw except for four, which were won by stall-holders of local Markets, and which were delivered to them at the next scheduled Market.<br><br>  
 
Everything in the Profit and Loss statement is true and correct, backed by invoices, receipts, and paypal/bank statements. The family received the Wignall funds in full. We sustained an enormous loss from this campaign, and used the raffle ticket income to offset a little of this loss. Given the enormous amount of time, energy, effort, and personal funds we invested, this figure represented a very small percentage in terms of “administration” costs.<br><br>  
 
Two very different Fundraising Campaigns. One embraced by the community and successful beyond all expectations. One ignored by the community, sustaining a huge loss for ourselves, yet due to our forward thinking and contingency planning, the family received a substantial amount from a very generous Wignall Ford.<br><br>   
 
There is success and failure risk in every endeavour. Especially so in fund-raising, as you are relying mostly on the generosity of others. Lessons have been learned from both campaigns.<br><br>  
 
However, to take one's good intentions and use them to vilify, slander, cast aspersions and publicly  cry “foul” when all of the above are factually correct, is  tantamount to a personal vendetta, using public forums to air personal grievances. The public love to jump on bandwagons, it is human nature. They especially love to expose supposed scams and wrong-doing. This is in some ways good. It keeps us all honest and does highlight things we should all be wary of.<br><br>  
 
If a personal vendetta however is constantly fuelled by lies and mis-information, then the public itself has a decision to make. In a democratic society, everyone is given the right to respond, and everyone is innocent unless PROVEN otherwise. This is the problem with bandwagons. If you jump on, knowing only one side of the story, you are bound to be biased in your response and your support. So please. Carefully consider all of the above, and now that you have both sides of the story for both campaigns, form a clear and unbiased opinion.<br><br>  
 
There are many good people out there, generously giving time, effort and financial aid to those less fortunate. We are some of these people. Good people. We will continue to help others, both publicly and privately, when we see a real need arise.  We will, however in future be a lot more thorough in our investigations prior to offering help. It is distasteful to us that we must do this, because charity should be UNCONDITIONAL. Assumptions however, are what this public vilification has been based on, and what we ourselves based our second fund-raiser on. And assumptions sometimes do make asses of us all.
